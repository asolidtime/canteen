A cute lil' game launcher.
This is made mostly for my personal use. It's still rapidly undergoing changes and is probably pretty unstable.  
I plan to write some proper documentation once I finish up the core functionality and deem the code robust enough for other people to use (tldr: probably before January ends)
However, if someone has somehow found this project and plans to use it, feel free to create an issue. I'll usually be quick to write up a fix (that is, unless said fix is incredibly complicated to implement, in which case I'll just ignore you)
